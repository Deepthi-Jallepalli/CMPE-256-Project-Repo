# CMPE-256-Project-Repo

In the folder, Community_Prediction_LPA, there are 2 files as lpa_com_pred_total.ipynb which has the generation of graphs for both synchronous Label propagation and Asynchronous Label Propagation for all the ego networks present in the data set and Comm_pred_eval_metrics_py.ipynb has the community detection graphs, evaluation metrics for the 698 egonode along with the represntation of communities from the same ego network. 
To run the files, the first 2 cells are to be deleted if in a PC or works good in colab. Also, the path to the data should be set accordingly.
